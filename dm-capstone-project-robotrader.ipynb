(AMZN) - Q3 2025 Earnings Summary and Analyst Price Target\n\n**Q3 2025 Earnings Report Highlights:**\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. reported a strong third quarter for fiscal year 2025, exceeding analyst expectations. Key highlights include:\n\n*   **Net Sales:** Increased by 13% year-over-year to $180.2 billion, up from $158.9 billion in the same period of 2024. This growth was driven by strong performance across various segments, including online stores ($67.41 billion), AWS ($33.01 billion), and advertising services ($17.70 billion).\n*   **Net Income:** Surged by 38.2% to $21.2 billion, resulting in earnings per share (EPS) of $1.95, beating analyst estimates of $1.58 by 23.42%. This significant increase in net income was partly attributed to pre-tax gains of $9.5 billion from investments in Anthropic, PBC.\n*   **AWS Growth:** Amazon Web Services (AWS) demonstrated significant re-acceleration, growing 20.2% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for AI infrastructure.\n*   **Operating Income:** Reported at $17.4 billion. However, this figure includes special charges totaling $4.3 billion, consisting of a $2.5 billion legal settlement with the FTC and $1.8 billion in severance costs. Without these charges, operating income would have been $21.7 billion.\n*   **Q4 2025 Guidance:** Amazon anticipates net sales to be in the range of $206.0 billion to $213.0 billion, representing a 10% to 13% growth compared to the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n**Analyst Consensus Price Target:**\n\nThe consensus analyst price target for Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) stock is approximately **$294.97**, with a range from a low of **$229.37** to a high of **$369.46**. This target represents an estimated increase of 30.36% from the current stock price. The stock currently holds a consensus rating of \"Strong Buy\" among analysts.\nDecisionMakingAgent > **Decision:** BUY\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) delivered a robust Q3 2025 earnings report, exceeding analyst expectations and demonstrating strong growth across key business segments.\n\n*   **Financial Performance:** Net sales increased by a healthy 13% year-over-year, and net income surged by 38.2%, significantly outpacing analyst estimates. The re-acceleration in AWS growth, up 20.2%, is particularly positive, indicating strong demand for AI infrastructure.\n*   **Analyst Sentiment:** The consensus analyst rating is a \"Strong Buy,\" with a consensus price target of $294.97, representing a substantial upside potential of over 30% from the current stock price.\n*   **Future Outlook:** The Q4 2025 guidance projects continued net sales growth of 10-13%, reinforcing the positive outlook.\n\nWhile the company did incur some special charges related to a legal settlement and severance costs, the underlying operational performance and future guidance are very strong. The significant gains from investments in Anthropic also provide a notable boost to net income.\n\nConsidering the strong financial results, positive analyst sentiment, and promising future guidance, a BUY recommendation is warranted.\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.
